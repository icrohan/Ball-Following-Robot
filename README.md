# Ball-Following-Robot
Ball-following robot using OpenCV and an ESP32 involves a combination of computer vision, microcontroller programming, and hardware interfacing.

Below is a detailed description of how you can build such a system:

*Components Needed*
ESP32: To control the motors and communicate with the OpenCV system.
Camera Module: ESP32-CAM or a USB camera connected to a computer running OpenCV.
Motor Driver: L298N or similar to drive the motors.
DC Motors and Wheels: For the robot's movement.
Chassis: For mounting the components.
Power Supply: For the motors and ESP32.
Computer: For running the OpenCV application.
System Architecture
OpenCV for Ball Detection: The computer running OpenCV captures frames from the camera, processes them to detect the ball, and determines the ball's position in the frame.
Communication with ESP32: Based on the ball's position, the OpenCV application sends control commands to the ESP32 to adjust the robot's movement.
Motor Control: The ESP32 receives the commands and drives the motors accordingly to follow the ball.
